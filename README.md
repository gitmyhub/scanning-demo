# Scanning Demo

    1)  clone or download the project from GitHub. 

    2) go to the Project root directory(which should be scanning-demo) in your terminal and do "npm install". 

    3) do "npm start" and wait till the server starts up

    4) open chrome browser and you should be able to access the project using http://localhost:4200 

    5) it will prompt you to give permission to enable webcam

    6) I have attached 3 barcodes that you should be able to scan. I would suggest you to open the barcodes in your phone and use the landscape mode to fill the entire view port of your Desktop/Laptop screen with the barcode on your mobile while scanning. 

    7) As you scan, it will wait for 2 seconds to re-scan either the same bar code or the next one. I did this to avoid duplicate scans of the same barcode.

    8) it should open a print dialog when you click on exit application.
